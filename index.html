    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: August 13, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>BeamSling</strong> (the "App") is published by <strong>Mousemeats</strong> ("we", "our", or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information in connection with the App. By using the App you agree to the terms described below.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally-identifying information directly. However, the App uses third-party advertising services that may collect information for advertising and measurement purposes. Specifically, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (for example, Google Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>Usage data related to ads (ad impressions, clicks, interactions)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with Google’s policies. We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Information collected by AdMob is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display relevant ads to users</li>
        <li>Measure and analyze ad performance</li>
        <li>Comply with legal requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for advertising. For details on how Google collects and uses data, see Google’s privacy pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads / Advertising Technologies</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. GDPR (EEA & UK) and CCPA (California) Choices</h2>
    <p><strong>GDPR</strong> — If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, you may be presented with a choice to receive personalized ads. You may withdraw or change that choice in your device settings or within the consent prompt (if shown).</p>
    <p><strong>CCPA</strong> — California residents may opt out of the sale of personal information. In practice, you can opt out of personalized ads by changing your device ad settings or following Google’s opt-out instructions.</p>
    <p>General options include resetting your advertising ID or turning off personalized advertising in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected personal data from a child under 13, please contact us and we will take steps to delete the information.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>We do not retain user personal data ourselves. Data collected by third parties (like AdMob) is retained and processed according to their policies. We take reasonable measures to protect information under our control, but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy here with a revised "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
